      "subtitle": "Graduate Thesis \"One eloquent wrapped gesture\"",
      "description": "The thesis is comprised of two tracks, sampling and wrapping, neither a parallel track but an interconnected thread. Creating a working methodology of sampling suggests an open space where different architectural languages can cross-pollinate or contaminate, creating new territories and imagining new possibilities. This is the driver of the design but the aesthetic and outcome aren’t an evident sample – similar to contemporary hip hop – but an expression of new coherencies. The wrapper – an amorphic entity – is the force driving these coherencies through the surface in a unified and continuous envelope. The design seeks to maximize the expressive potential of various architectural configurations by condensing their figurative allusions into one eloquent wrapped gesture.",

      "description": "CD studied advanced methods of project delivery and construction documents by incorporating digital technologies and investigating new models for linking design and construction processes. Located in Los Angles, we analyzed and developed the architecture by creating a detailed 3D digital model and a set of 2D construction documents specifically tailored for the design challenges of a single unit residential project. We explored current industry standards in wood frame construction and through exploiting common residential forms and materials. Our study consisted of the manipulation and re-composition of these residential elements for a live/work mixed-use complex.",

      "description": "The ADU creates an environment that is welcoming, quiet and private. It takes the fear out of housing others in your backyard. It creates an extension of the landscape that can create community. The problem of the ADU is not building them or affording them but convincing a community and individuals that it won’t decrease their quality of life. The living arrangement is pragmatic, simple and contains itself within a minimal surface area. These rooms use economical and quick stick frame construction. The entirety of the construction is found within a 32’x32’ volume. The roof becomes the spatial element that makes the project worthy of constructing in a backyard, and although a traditional asphalt shingle would reduce the cost immensely, the benefits provided by a green roof makes the project worth it.

The homogenous grid throughout the project is both virtual and physical, the organizer and the thing to be interrupted. The site has a virtual 3D grid that hovers both in digital space and in physical space on the site, but how we addressed the heterogeneous question – also part of the brief – is by interrupting this 3D spatial matrix with three nested, very largescale rooms in section. Typically, in an arrangement where you might see a heterogeneous space interrupting a homogeneous space, it is seen as a plan move.",

There really isn't anywhere to build in London. Possibly the most hidden in plain sight space that exists within the confines of the city are the alleyways, created by the terraces behind every townhome. The narrow, long block townhouse scheme is so common in London that its typology finds itself within practically every socioeconomic, ethnic and cultural strata. A proposal that could fit within this space could be an \"anywhere London\" proposal. Elevate it as to not completely eliminate the terraces. Taper the bottom and open up the central circulation to let in light and air, and you have a solution to restock London housing.",

Exploring the idea of layering through figural walls and volumes as well as thinking of the water plane as a surface. The model serves as an interior courtyard scape, open air above but moments where you are able to glimpse into the project from the facade.",
